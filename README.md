## Dissertation Topic: "Machine Learning Algorithms and Applications"<br>
* The thesis for my PG program Electronic Circuits and System Design include the classification of handwritten digits of Arabic and English numeric digits. Different popular Machine Learning algorithms are implemented and compared on two different datasets viz. MNIST and MADBase(Modified Arabic DataBase). Finally a hybrid simple linear ML algorithm based on Logistic Regression is developed.<br>
* This repository contains the thesis report which includes the detailed work.<br>
* All the relevant codes are appended in the appendix section of the report.<br>
* The top performing algorithms are uploaded seperately.
